ladder_strategy.py — weekly-anchored mean-reversion ladder (score-only).

Ported unchanged (logic-wise) from the fpga-tick-engine project's
host/ladder_strategy.py. This is the whole strategy: it compares the
current price against a fixed BASELINE re-anchored once a week, and
buys in tranches as price falls below it:

    level 1 buy   price <= baseline * (1 - step)
    level 2 buy   price <= baseline * (1 - 2*step)
    level 3 buy   price <= baseline * (1 - 3*step)      ... up to max_levels
    sell (all)    price >= baseline * (1 + step), while holding

Because the trigger is a STATIC level rather than a moving indicator,
the strategy needs no time-based cooldown — the level index itself
provides hysteresis: having already bought level N, only a further
price drop (crossing level N+1) or a full recovery (the sell
threshold) can fire again.

DELIBERATELY SCORE-ONLY, not wired to trade. It never touches a
broker. Feed it ticks via on_tick(), and read its numbers (positions,
pnl_e4, trips, wins, fees_usd) the same way as any other
StrategyScorecard.

This is functionally a grid / martingale-style averaging-down ladder:
exposure GROWS as price falls further, which is exactly backwards from
"cut losses, let winners run." It performs fine in a genuinely
range-bound week and can compound badly in a real, sustained trend.
There is still (deliberately, per current settings) no stop-loss — a
losing position is never force-closed. Exposure IS bounded, two ways:
max_levels * qty_per_level shares, and — if max_notional_usd is set —
total dollars committed to one symbol while a position is open, which
stops the ladder from buying a further level even if max_levels hasn't
been reached yet. Neither of those is a stop-loss: they cap how much
MORE can be added to a loser, not when an existing loser gets closed.
Treat any numbers from this strategy with that in mind — a few good
weeks prove nothing about the one week a real trend runs through it.

Re-anchoring semantics: calling set_baseline() with a new value does
NOT force-close an open position. Levels bought and the weighted-
average cost basis carry over; only the buy/sell trigger PRICES move
to the new baseline from that point on. This is a design choice, not
the only possible one — an alternative would force-flatten every
Monday before re-anchoring. Change on_signal() below if you'd rather
do that.
